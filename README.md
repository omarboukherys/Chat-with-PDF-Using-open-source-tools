# Chat-with-text_files-Using-open-source-tools

In this notebook, I demonstrate how to interact with your files using open-source tools. I developed this notebook on Kaggle, and to execute the code, you should enable the GPU function.

You have the flexibility to customize the notebook (upload any file of your choice) and leverage any tool, whether paid (such as OpenAI tools) or open source, just like I did.

Feel free to contact me for further information.
